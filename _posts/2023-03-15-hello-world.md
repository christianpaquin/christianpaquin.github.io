Hello World!

To echo the words from the [about](../about.md) page:
I'm cryptography engineer at Microsoft Research (my [MSR page](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/cpaquin/)) where I aim to bring new research innovations closer to reality. I'll be using this space to share news and insights about my work on identity, security, and cryptography.
