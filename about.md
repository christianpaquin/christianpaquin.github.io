I'm cryptography engineer at Microsoft Research (my [MSR page](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/cpaquin/)) where I aim to bring new research innovations closer to reality. I'll be using this space to share news and insights about my work on identity, security, and cryptography. I've long focussed on privacy-enhancing technology; prior to joining Microsoft I was a crypto developer at Zero Knowledge Systems developing a TOR-precursor mixnet and the Chief Security Engineer at Credentica where we developed the U-Prove technology (and we continued this journey at Microsoft after being acquired).

Some recent projects I've been involved with:
* **Content provenance**: I participate in the [Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA)](https://c2pa.org/), exploring how modern cryptographic tools can help realize new origin validation use cases. I also lead the development of the [Cross-Platform Origin of Content (XPOC)](https://github.com/microsoft/xpoc-framework) implementing a portable "blue checkmark" for social accounts and media platforms.

* **Post-Quantum Cryptography**: I'm a core developer in the [Open Quantum Safe](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe) project now part of the Linux Foundation's [PQC Alliance](https://pqca.org/), and I'm also leading the interoperability and performance workstream in the [NIST NCCoE PQC](https://www.nccoe.nist.gov/crypto-agility-considerations-migrating-post-quantum-cryptographic-algorithms) project.

* **Privacy-enhancing identity technology**: I lead the development of the [U-Prove technology](https://microsoft.com/uprove), a powerful minimal disclosure technology that can be used to build privacy-preserving credentials. I participate in [BBS Signatures](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/bbs-signature) DIF working group and the OAuth [Selective-Disclosure JWT](https://github.com/oauth-wg/oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt) working group; moving these standards closer to deployment. 

* **SMART Health Card**: I participated in the development of the [SMART Health Card](https://smarthealth.cards/) framework, used to develop the US/Canadian electronic COVID-19 vaccination cards. For more info on the topic, see my [Shmoocon2023 slides](../presentations/shmoocon2023_paquin_shc.pdf).
