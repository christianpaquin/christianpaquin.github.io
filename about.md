I'm cryptography engineer at Microsoft Research (my [MSR page](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/cpaquin/)) where I aim to bring new research innovations closer to reality. I'll be using this space to share news and insights about my work on identity, security, and cryptography. Get more details on my [github profile](https://github.com/christianpaquin). You can always reach out to at `cpaquin` @ `microsoft` . `com`.

Some recent projects I've been involved with:
* **Post-Quantum Cryptography**: I'm a core developer in the [Open Quantum Safe](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe) project, and I'm also participating in the [NIST NCCoE PQC](https://www.nccoe.nist.gov/crypto-agility-considerations-migrating-post-quantum-cryptographic-algorithms) project.

* **Privacy-enhancing identity technology**: I lead the development of the [U-Prove technology](https://microsoft.com/uprove), a powerful minimal disclosure technology that can be used to build privacy-preserving credentials. I participate in [BBS Signatures](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/bbs-signature) DIF working group and the OAuth [Selective-Disclosure JWT](https://github.com/oauth-wg/oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt) working group; moving these standards closer to deployment. 

* **SMART Health Card**: I participated in the development of the [SMART Health Card](https://smarthealth.cards/) framework, used to develop electronic COVID-19 vaccination cards. For more info on the topic, see my [Shmoocon2023 slides](../presentations/shmoocon2023_paquin_shc.pdf).
